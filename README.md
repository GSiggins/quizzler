### Workflow:

-Established structure of pages to show/hide.

-Wrote question objects with applicable true/fase values to the answers.

-Used getElementById and querySelector to established variables for DOM elements.

-Used Math.random to choose a random question.

-Used object referencing to populate DOM elements with the randomly chosen question and answers.

-Spliced array to exclude chosen object so the question is not chosen again.
